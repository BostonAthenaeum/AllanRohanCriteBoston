    At 401 Shawmut Avenue, Crite first began to draw and illustrate.

Williams Municipal Building at 400 Shawmut Avenue. Crite was a frequent patron.[3]\n
    In a 1979 oral history, Crite recalled fondly his time at his family’s first Boston apartment, “Well, I lived there. You see, I lived at 401 Shawmut Ave. and I also practically lived in the library, right next door. So it meant a great deal to me, a part of my formative period, you might say.[4] The South End Branch held an exhibition of Crite’s work in 1950 as part of their Race History Week.[5]",

    The young artist spent key moments of his career inside the apartment that sat at the edge of Carter Playground in what was 
historically the center of Boston’s Black community following migrations from Beacon Hill, the American South, and the Caribbean.[1] 
The Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) marked Dilworth street as blighted in 1960 and slated the residential block for demolition 
as part of the South End Urban Renewal Project of 1962. The agency later proposed the cluster of apartment buildings be removed in favor 
of a new elementary school.[2] According to Byron Rushing, former President of the Museum of African American History and former MA State Representative, 
the Crite family and their neighbors were eventually displaced when transportation redevelopment authorities demolished 2 
Dilworth Street in 1971. Allan and his mother moved to a brownstone at 410 Columbus Avenue, and were among the more fortunate families that 
were able to relocate within the neighborhood. In total, the BRA estimated that a total of 1,517 families were displaced by the South End Urban Renewal Project.[3] ",

    Co-directed by Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) curator of prints FitzRoy Carrington, the museum and studio space exposed children 
    to fine art through MFA loans and coursework.[1] At the Children’s Art Centre, Crite received instruction from artists Charles Woodbury and Elizabeth Perkins, 
    both of whom believed anyone could be an artist through repetition, observation, and personal experience. Woodbury and Perkins acknowledged Crite’s talent during his years at the Art Centre, 
    included his drawings in their publication The Art of Seeing: Mental Training through Drawing (1925), and encouraged Crite to continue his work on Biblical Scriptures.[2] Although Crite was a young child during his time at the Centre, 
    Woodbury’s influence is seen throughout Crite’s trajectory and practice. Both Massachusetts painters had technical backgrounds; Woodbury received a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Crite studied technical design at 
    the School of the Museum of Fine Arts before becoming an illustrator for the Charlestown Navy Yard. The two painters also returned to the same environments repeatedly, painting from both observation and memory.[3] Crite became a member of the board of the Children’s Art Centre 
    in his later adulthood and credited the institution as his first coursework in the arts.[4]",

    Crite cited the MFA as having a profound influence on his career.. He recounted visits to the museum with his mother Annamae and the coursework provided through the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, 
    then known as the Museum School.\n Crite graduated from English High School in 1929, then located on Warren Avenue and Dartmouth Street in Boston’s South End. Throughout high school he attended weekend vocational 
    classes at the School of Museum of Fine Arts in composition, charcoal drawing, and textile design. Crite went on to attend and graduate from the Museum School on scholarship where he studied industrial design and a traditional 
    art curriculum, and ultimately merged his Episcopal faith with his artistic practice.[1] He shared, “[...] after seven and one half years of earnest study at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, I finally felt competent and confident 
    enough that at last it was possible for me to be able to illustrate the Spirituals with a living vigor, which would help preserve them in all their living beauty."[2]",
