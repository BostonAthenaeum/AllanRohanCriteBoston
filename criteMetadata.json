    "description": "In 1925 at the age of fifteen, Allan Rohan Crite moved with his family to 2 Dilworth Street in Lower Roxbury. The young artist spent key moments of his career inside the apartment that sat at the edge of Carter Playground in what was  historically the center of Boston’s Black community following migrations from Beacon Hill, the American South, and the Caribbean.[1] The Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) marked Dilworth street as blighted in 1960 and slated the residential block for demolition as part of the South End Urban Renewal Project of 1962. The agency later proposed the cluster of apartment buildings be removed in favor of a new elementary school.[2] According to Byron Rushing, former President of the Museum of African American History and former MA State Representative, the Crite family and their neighbors were eventually displaced when transportation redevelopment authorities demolished 2 Dilworth Street in 1971. Allan and his mother moved to a brownstone at 410 Columbus Avenue, and were among the more fortunate families that were able to relocate within the neighborhood. In total, the BRA estimated that a total of 1,517 families were displaced by the South End Urban Renewal Project.[3] ",

    "description": "Allan Rohan Crite attended free courses in the arts at the Children’s Art Centre on 36 Rutland Street. Co-directed by Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) curator of prints FitzRoy Carrington, the museum and studio space exposed children to fine art through MFA loans and coursework.[1] At the Children’s Art Centre, Crite received instruction from artists Charles Woodbury and Elizabeth Perkins, both of whom believed anyone could be an artist through repetition, observation, and personal experience. Woodbury and Perkins acknowledged Crite’s talent during his years at the Art Centre, included his drawings in their publication The Art of Seeing: Mental Training through Drawing (1925), and encouraged Crite to continue his work on Biblical Scriptures.[2] Although Crite was a young child during his time at the Centre, Woodbury’s influence is seen throughout Crite’s trajectory and practice. Both Massachusetts painters had technical backgrounds; Woodbury received a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Crite studied technical design at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts before becoming an illustrator for the Charlestown Navy Yard. The two painters also returned to the same environments repeatedly, painting from both observation and memory.[3] Crite became a member of the board of the Children’s Art Centre in his later adulthood and credited the institution as his first coursework in the arts.[4]",

In the 1938 broadside  “Why I Illustrate the Spirituals”, Crite cited the MFA as having a profound influence on his career.. He recounted visits to the museum with his mother Annamae and the coursework provided through the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, then known as the Museum School.\n Crite graduated from English High School in 1929, then located on Warren Avenue and Dartmouth Street in Boston’s South End. Throughout high school he attended weekend vocational classes at the School of Museum of Fine Arts in composition, charcoal drawing, and textile design. Crite went on to attend and graduate from the Museum School on scholarship where he studied industrial design and a traditional art curriculum, and ultimately merged his Episcopal faith with his artistic practice.[1] He shared, “[...] after seven and one half years of earnest study at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, I finally felt competent and confident enough that at last it was possible for me to be able to illustrate the Spirituals with a living vigor, which would help preserve them in all their living beauty.[2]",

    "description": "Allan Rohan Crite (1910-2007) grew up attending church services in the historically Black neighborhood known as the Port in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mother, Annamae, was a devout Episcopalian who joined St. Bartholomew’s upon moving from Plainfield, New Jersey to Boston in 1910. St. Bartholomew’s, originally founded with a Black congregation and clergy composed primarily of Caribbean immigrants, established itself as an diocesan mission with the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts the same year.[1]\n Crite attended and supported a number of Episcopal churches in the greater Boston area throughout his lifetime, becoming an active member of St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in the South End later in his adulthood.[2]At St. Bartholomew’s and in the Port neighborhood more broadly, the young Allan Crite was ensconced by a Black spiritual world.[3] His painting Cambridge, Sunday Morning (1939) depicts a connected community of Black churchgoers on Columbia Street just north of Austin Street, or what is now Bishop Allen Drive. The steeple of Union Baptist Church, which maintained a historically Black congregation, can be seen in the distance.[4]\nCrite’s religious works, notably his booklet Is It Nothing to You? (1948) published by the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, features some of the earliest depictions of a Black Jesus in the United States.[5] In a 1978 oral history with the artist, when he was questioned about his motivations for depicting Black liturgical figures, he replied succinctly, “That's the interpretation that I used. St. Bartholomew's Church is a Black church, so I had that.[6] Beyond inspiration, St. Bartholomew’s rector and vestry, along with the South End’s St. Augustine and St. Martin’s Episcopal Church, directly participated in Crite’s art career. They loaned two paintings, The Baptismal Font (1940) and The Rector’s Greeting (1938), to the Museum of African American History’s 1982 show, The Lost and Found Paintings of Allan Rohan Crite.[7] In Cambridge, just as in the South End and Lower Roxbury, Crite observed the community surrounding him with reverence, portraying the divine and ordinary as one.",

    "description": "Allan Rohan Crite (1910-2007) visited the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, with his mother Annamae through classes at the Children’s Art Centre in the South End. He often cited fond memories of his time exploring “the palace” and its collections as it was a short walk from his home at 2 Dilworth Street.[1]\n In December 1933, the Gardner became the New England headquarters for the Federal Public Works Art Project, where Crite received his stipend as a selected artist beginning in 1934.[2] he program aimed to assist unemployed artists during the Great Depression and ended in June of the same year. The opportunity allowed Crite to produce a number of oil paintings, including Late Afternoon (1934) and Street Scene (1934).[3] He maintained a lifelong relationship to the museum, drawing references from its collections for his paintings and publications.[4]",

    "description": "Crite’s Neighborhood Series is lauded for its depictions of the South End and Lower Roxbury, containing references to the social change experienced in his community throughout his lifetime. The steeple of Peoples Baptist Church and the recreational fields of the Carter Playground are seen in the distance of Crite’s Harriet and Leon (1941). In The News (1945), the artist shows four Black men (three in plain dress and one in military uniform) reading headlines of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s passing on the corner of Columbus Avenue and Northampton Street in front of an altered version of the Columbus AME Zion Church.\n While the scenes in Harriet and Leon and The News are relatively quiet, they embody over a century of social change. According to historian Thomas H. O’Connor, the Black population in Boston maintained a largely self-contained community of approximately 1,800 to 2,000 people on the northwestern slope of Beacon Hill until the late 1890’s. The Peoples Baptist Church and Columbus Avenue AME Zion Church represent Black congregations that began in the Beacon Hill neighborhood, but were forced to relocate to Lower Roxbury as they traced the moving and growing Black population southwest. In the 1900’s, migrations from Beacon Hill, the West Indies, and the American South boomed in the South End and Lower Roxbury. The Black population grew to more than 10,000 people and doubled to over 20,000 by the 1930’s.[1] Both the Peoples Baptist Church and Columbus Avenue AME Zion Church owned buildings in the burgeoning neighborhood by the early twentieth century where they witnessed the Boston Redevelopment Authority’s 1962 South End Urban Renewal Project and university expansion disrupt and displace the lives of their community members.[2] The congregations still stand and worship in Lower Roxbury today, a testament to their resilience.",

    "description": "Allan Rohan Crite (1910-2007) depicted Lenox Street and its surroundings in much of his work while living nearby at the now demolished 2 Dilworth Street.\n In his art, Crite blended memory, documentary, and narrative elements, often reworking or reimagining scenes from his everyday encounters. Crite’s watercolor Just Greetings (1940) is one example of a painting that includes his description of the work’s location. On the back of the paper, he wrote, “Camden St. Near Shawmut Ave.”[1] The watercolor shows the block adjacent to the then recently opened Lenox Street Projects, the first public housing project in the city intentionally built for African Americans, and at the future site of the Camden Street Apartments.[2] Crite also created several works depicting construction of the apartment site, including The Last of Dillon Street (1940).[3]\n Photographer Winifred Irish Hall, who also lived and spent time in the South End and Lower Roxbury, took pictures of the Lenox Street Projects surroundings and residents. Her photographs share a remarkable comparison to Crite’s work.[4]The two artists offer a glimpse into a neighborhood that would see accelerated building demolition and displacement of its residents when the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) put forth its South End Urban Renewal Project in 1962.",
